    <p>
        My name is Scott Anderson, and I'm the web designer you didn't even know you need! I am a Twin Cities based web developer with front-end experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React as well as back-end technologies like MySQL and MongoDB.
        <br><br>
        I have a passion to learn and be exposed to new languages and cutting-edge technologies, and I can and will master them quickly. I also make shoot and edit films in my spare time, and I love the attention to detail and precision required to take a project from inception through to finished product.
